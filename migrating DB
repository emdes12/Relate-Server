Before migrating your local DB note the below

1. run pg dump
    pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost -d relateplus -F c -f updated_dump.dump

2. enter your postrgesql password

3. run pg restore to forward to railway
    pg_restore -U postgres -h yamabiko.proxy.rlwy.net -p 15233 -d railway --no-owner updated_dump.dump

--clean was removed from the above because, It first clear all tables and records in railway db before restoring the dumped file.

4. enter your railway db password which is MezvhpgszvZSbfGXUIaxTvmMuSItqaaR





GOOD LUCK
